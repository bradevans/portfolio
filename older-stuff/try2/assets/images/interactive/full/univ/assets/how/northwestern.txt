Examples of other contributions: Northwestern makes cash gifts and other gifts on a case-by-case basis. The university, for instance, promised $120,000 over three years, beginning in 2008, as seed money to help set up a foundation for the local school district. And Northwestern's new president, Morton O. Schapiro, directed the university to donate $550,000 to the city last fall for the purchase of a new fire truck.
