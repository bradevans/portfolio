		<div class="descriptions">The second iteration of a website I conceived, designed and coded for New York State Assemblyman Rafael Espinal. With this iteration I updated the overall design which included creating a new logo, big footer, new navigation and javascript-based photo carousel. Code updates were primarily for the photo carousel although general clean up was also done.</div>

		<div class="descriptions">My friends and I LOVE playing this game Phase 10 (you should try it, bet you love it too) but it can be a bit of a pain to write out the scorecard at the start of each game. So I thought I'd just make a web app for iPhone to handle the scorekeeping for us. It's been acting up lately, but instead of fixing it I'm in the process of updating it to look less like its current design - which is just a riff of the original game design - and making it for multiple screen sizes. It will look and work much better soon.</div>
