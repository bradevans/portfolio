The preceding requirements are intended to comply with 15Five's rights and obligations under the DMCA, including 17 U.S.C. §512(c), but do not constitute legal advice.  It may be advisable to contact an attorney regarding your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws. </p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Customer Service; Customer Communications and Notice. </strong>Please email tos@15five.com for further assistance. Under these Terms, you expressly agree and consent to receive communications and notices, including any notices required by law, from 15Five electronically (in lieu of communication by postal mail). You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the 15Five Services. You expressly acknowledge and agree that we may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the 15Five Services, and special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your profile settings.  Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. </li>
				<li><strong>Eligibility.</strong> THE COMPANY SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE OR TO ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE COMPANY SERVICES BY COMPANY. 15Five may terminate your account, delete any content or information that you have posted on the 15Five Services, and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Services (or any portion, aspect or feature of the Services) for any reason or no reason, at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice, including without limitation if it believes that you are under 18.  By clicking the "I Agree" button or by otherwise subscribing to or using the 15Five Services you represent that you are at least 18 years of age. </li>
				<li><strong>Account Activity Responsibility. </strong><br />
						<p><strong>9.1	User Accounts.</strong> In order to use certain aspects of the 15Five Services, you will have to register and create an account ("User Account"). When creating your account for the 15Five Services, you agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. You further agree to maintain and update your personal information as needed to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your ID, password, or any credit, debit or charge card number), you agree to immediately notify 15Five. You may be liable for the losses incurred by 15Five or others due to any unauthorized use of your account. </p>
						<p><strong>9.2	Administrator Accounts.</strong> The person who first completes the 15Five Services registration on behalf of any Subscribing Organization is the initial "Administrator" for purposes of such Subscribing Organization's use of the 15Five Services, and exercises certain options to initially determine the level of access, privacy, and security for the 15Five Services related to the Subscribing Organization ("Administrator Account"). For example, the Administrator will determine who can be a User of the 15Five Services under the Subscribing Organization associated with that Administrator and Subscribing Organization and the level of privileges that such Users will possess. Once initial registration has been completed, each Subscribing Organization will be able to register additional Administrators, as permitted by the functionality of the 15Five Service.  Each Administrator may designate other Users as additional and/or successor Administrators, and is responsible for confirming that those person(s) accept such responsibility. Upon becoming an Administrator, each person will be deemed to agree to the obligations hereunder. In addition, any person designated as the billing contact in the 15Five Services billing record for a Subscribing Organization will be deemed to assume the rights and obligations of an Administrator. Administrator Accounts must comply in all respects with Section 9.1 above.  ADMINISTRATORS ARE FULLY AND SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ACTIVITY OCCURRING UNDER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT.</p>
						<p><strong>9.3	Account Information.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that 15Five may access, preserve and disclose your account information and related contents if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any Information violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of 15Five, its users, or the public.</p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>10.	Payment Terms; Charges and Taxes. </strong><br />
						<p><strong>10.1	Billing.</strong> Customer will pay for the 15Five Services on a monthly basis as set forth on the 15Five order page.  We may add or adjust Service fees at any time by providing you with thirty (30) days prior notice.  You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account made by you or anyone who uses your account (including your Administrators). </p>
						<p><strong>10.2	Payment.</strong> All payments due are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated on the order page.  Fees for credit card orders are due immediately upon order placement.  Declined credit card authorizations shall be considered delinquent.   You agree to pay for all services that you purchase through the 15Five order page, and we may charge your selected payment method for any such fees owed.  You are required to keep your billing information current, complete, and accurate (e.g., a change in billing address, credit card number, or expiration date) and to notify 15Five if your selected payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft).  Authorization to charge your chosen payment method account will remain in effect until you cancel or modify your payment preferences; provided, however, that such notice will not affect charges submitted before 15Five could reasonably act.  Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described on the 15Five order page.  You agree that charges may be accumulated as incurred and may be submitted as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of the applicable billing cycle.  You must cancel your subscription at least five business days prior to the first day of the next calendar month to avoid being charged the renewal fee for such month.  THERE ARE NO REFUNDS FOR MONTHLY FEES PAID HEREUNDER, FOR ANY REASON. </p>
						<p><strong>10.3	Delinquent Payments.</strong> Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.  Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by 15Five in collecting such delinquent amounts, except where such delinquent amounts are due to 15Five's billing inaccuracies. </p>
				</li>
				<li><strong>11.	Users' Rights to Information.</strong> Upon any termination of a User's account, Users will have fifteen (15) days to request a copy of all data that has been input by or on behalf of the User into such User's account on the 15Five Services.  15Five will provide the data in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format within two (2) business days of such request, to the e-mail address on file in the User's account.  Fifteen (15) days after termination of a User's account, 15Five will have no obligation to retain, and liability for, all User data. </li>

				</li>
				<li><strong>13.	Violations; Termination.</strong> You agree that 15Five, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may have with 15Five. In addition, 15Five reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the 15Five Services at any time, including the right to discontinue the display of any Information. You agree that any termination of your access to the 15Five Services or any account you may have or portion thereof may be affected without prior notice, and you agree that 15Five will not be liable to you or any third-party for such termination. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the 15Five Services may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies 15Five may have at law or in equity. </li>
				<li><strong>14.	User Provided Information. </strong><br />
						<p><strong>14.1	Definition of User Provided Information; Ownership.</strong> 15Five may now or in the future permit the uploading of Information through the 15Five Services ("User Provided Information"), and the hosting, sharing, display and/or analysis of such User Provided Information. Users may use their account settings to control other Users' access to their User Provided Information ("User Permissions").  15Five will use its commercially reasonable efforts to apply User Permissions. However, 15Five does not guarantee that User Permissions will always be applied, or that your User Provided Information will be kept secure from viewing by others, or from damage or loss.  15Five takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Provided Information that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the 15Five Services. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Provided Information that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the 15Five Services is solely your responsibility.  If you want 15Five to remove your User Provided Information from the 15Five Services, please delete it as specified in the 15Five Services. However, other Users may have already copied or forwarded your User Provided Information to others, making recovery impossible. 15Five is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Provided Information. You understand that whether or not such User Provided Information is displayed, 15Five does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Provided Information. Users retain all right, title, and interest in and to all User Provided Information. </p>
						<p><strong>14.2	License Grant to 15Five.</strong> By submitting User Provided Information to 15Five Services, you hereby grant to 15Five a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, and royalty-free license to use, display, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate and analyze your User Provided Information within the 15Five Services in any formats and through any applicable channels for the purposes of providing the applicable features and functionality of the 15Five Services and improving the way the 15Five Services work and look, and to create new features and functionality. This license does not grant 15Five the right to use your User Provided Information for any other commercial purposes. </p>
						<p><strong>14.3	Limited License Grant to other 15Five Users.</strong> By submitting User Provided Information to 15Five Services, in cases where you display your User Provided Information for other Users to view or when you directly exchange or otherwise provide your User Provided Information to other Users as permitted by certain 15Five Services functionality and these Terms, you hereby grant to such Users of the 15Five Services a non-exclusive license to use, display, and reproduce such User Provided Information as necessary for such Users to use the relevant 15Five Services functionality or features. </p>
						<p><strong>14.4	License Termination.</strong> The foregoing licenses granted by you terminate as to specific User Provided Information once you remove or delete such User Provided Information from the 15Five Services; except for 15Five's right to archive such User Provided Information in accordance with its standard policies and to use such Information in aggregate form to improve the way the 15Five Services work and look, and to create new features and functionality. </p>
						<p><strong>14.5	Required Rights. </strong>You shall be solely responsible for your own User Provided Information and the consequences of posting or publishing it. In connection with User Provided Information, you affirm, covenant, represent and warrant that you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and to authorize 15Five and 15Five's Users to use the User Provided Information uploaded by you as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section 14, and otherwise in the manner contemplated by 15Five and these Terms. </p>
						<p><strong>14.6	User Provided Information Representations.</strong> You agree not to submit User Provided Information that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (iv) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, or otherwise objectionable; (v) contains any information or content that is illegal; (vi) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (vii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current.  You agree that any User Provided Information that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy.  15Five reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Provided Information that 15Five believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. </p>
						<p><strong>14.7	User Provided Information Disclaimer.</strong> You understand that when using 15Five Services you will be exposed to User Provided Information from a variety of sources, and that 15Five is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Provided Information. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Provided Information that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against 15Five with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold 15Five, its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of User Provided Information. 15Five does not endorse any User Provided Information or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein or based upon such User Provided Information, and 15Five expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Provided Information. If notified by a User or a content owner of User Provided Information that allegedly does not conform to these Terms, 15Five may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove the User Provided Information, which it reserves the right to do at any time. 15Five does not permit copyright infringing activities on 15Five Services. </p>
