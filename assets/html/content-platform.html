<p class="pressSource">Education</p>
<p>Attending public schools in the district Rafael always felt that there weren't enough educational programs easily available to residents in the community of all ages. That issue still remains. As a former teacher of an Adult Literacy program in East New York, Education will be his top priority. Rafael is looking to bring more adult literacy and  GED programs back into the district to empower our community. Neighborhood residents will receive the tools needed to capitalize on opportunities and better paying jobs.<br />Rafael will also look to find ways to implement more arts programs into our public schools. There is a lot of talent in our schools and most of our kids are never able to tap into it because the schools don't provide enough arts programs during school hours. Rafael believes that the future of our community starts with them.</p>
